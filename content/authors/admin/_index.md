## About Me

My research centers on leveraging recent advancements in deep learning and multi-sensory perception to improve flexibility in robot learning. I am particularly interested in decision-making for task execution driven by diverse sensory inputs such as force, tactile feedback, and language. I have authored three first-author publications â€” including papers in ICRA 2024 and RA-L, with one currently under review for CASE 2025. Additionally, I have contributed to three ASME conference papers (MSEC and IDETC), with our MSEC 2024 paper receiving the Best Conference Paper Award (2nd place).
