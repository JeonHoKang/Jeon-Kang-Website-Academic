    #   I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

My research focuses on using recent developments in deep learning with different sensory modalities to enhance flexibility in robot learning. Particularly, I am fascinated by decision making during task driven by multi-sensory input such as force, tactile and language. I have published first author papers to three (One under review CASE 2025) including ICRA2024, RA-L(Journal) and have published to have three ASME papers including MSEC and iDETC. Our MSEC 2024 paper won Best Conference Paper Award (2nd place).
